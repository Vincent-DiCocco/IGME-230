## IV. Story

This game is a light-hearted platformer in which the player attempts to collect coins within a predefined level in a time limit. While
the minimum viable product involves only a single level, stretch goals include multiple levels the player will progress through linearly
by collecting enough coins on previous levels.


## V. Esthetics

The game will have cartoonish graphics with ambient sounds such as wind. There will also be a sound used when the player collects a coin.


## VI. Gameplay

The player is able to move around and jump in 2d.
The game will be using keyboard only.
The player learning experience will be a screen before the game which gives the buttons for each movement. To achieve the best score, the
player must learn the controls as well as the most efficient path through the level.
